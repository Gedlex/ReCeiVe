# ReCeiVe

The LuaLaTex class ReCeiVe provides a wide variety of possible cv structures and allows the user to change many details easily. The class is written in such a manner that it should not be necessary to alternate it in any way in order to get the desired cv layout.

Credits also go to Claud D. Park aka posquit0 and Jan Vorisek on whose CV templates the ReCeiVe classe is based on.
